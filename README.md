# Houdini bot plugin

Bot plugin for Houdini CPPS emulator.

Currently, this plugin's main focus is AS2 media, so bots will react to their environment as if there were playing on a AS2 client.

## Setup

Copy the sample configuration file `config.json.sample` to `bot/config.json`. Edit it to your liking.
Then, copy the `bot` directory into Houdini's `houdini/plugins` directory.
